# Python_For_Finance

This repository is a self-learning library for myself wherein I post various methods and code snippets for usin python in finance.

PyFin_3 : Plotted data on mulitple stocks and also normalised plotting.

Fig1: When data is on different scale and not normalised.

Fig2: When df is divided by first day price of df in order to normalise.

PyFin_4: Used the time function to time operations (useful when optimizing)

PyFin_5: Bollinger bands and how to use them?

Fig4: How to make decisions based on Bollinger bands

PyFin_6: It's about the stddev and plotting histograms on cumsum() and etc.

*PyFin_7*: Most important lesson; for y = beta(x) + alpha ; beta= sensitivity wrt to market and alpha=performance wrt market. Important learning was kurtosis and it's role in analysis.Check below figures.
